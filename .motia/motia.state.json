  "KSBUD-9667003:last_conversation": "{\"query\":\"Why is my agent failing on technical queries?\",\"response\":\"Based on the context provided, your AI agent seems to be failing on technical queries due to ambiguity and lack of specificity in its programming. Here are the identified issues and corresponding solutions:\\n\\n1. Ambiguity in fallback rules for provider determination: The agent doesn't have clear rules to fall back on when it encounters an uncertain situation. This could lead to incorrect or unpredictable responses. To fix this, you should specify clearer fallback conditions, like defaulting to 'Xactimate' in certain scenarios.\\n\\n2. Allowed provider output outside specified options: The agent is not limited to providing output strictly as 'symbility' or 'xactimate.' This can cause issues if the agent provides a response that is not within the expected provider options. To improve, you should restrict the provider output strictly to these two options.\\n\\n3. Instructions for choosing 'scope' providers lack specificity: The agent doesn't have explicit guidelines on using table borders, headers, and price lists to determine providers. This leads to errors in provider selection. Including explicit instructions in these areas can help the agent make more accurate decisions.\\n\\n4. System prompt lacks guidance for identifying specific visual indicators: The agent doesn't have enough guidance on identifying specific visual features to determine providers. Providing specific examples of visual features could aid the agent in correctly identifying providers.\\n\\nRemember, the key to improving your AI agent's performance on technical queries lies in providing clear instructions, precise fallback rules, and restricting outputs to expected options. This will help reduce ambiguity and enhance the agent's decision-making process.\",\"timestamp\":\"2025-03-19T18:41:07.146Z\",\"hasError\":false}",
